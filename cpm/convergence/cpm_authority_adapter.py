"""CPM-owned canonical authority adapter (CPM convergence Step 2a).

Sits between the existing CPM semantic model and the Step 1
``cpm_compat_v1`` projection:

    CPM semantic model (prod_scope / semantic_snapshot_*; unchanged)
        -> CpmAuthorityAdapter   (this module; provider-shaped facade)
        -> cpm_compat_v1 projection + exact-answer interpreter (Step 1)
        -> canonical broker (sfm_master_authority_productionized.runtime)

This module:

* locates the canonical package with the same ``sys.executable``-derived
  MAINMENU formula as the qualified production Normalizer, and verifies
  origin, module identity, API and build before obtaining the one broker
  through ``runtime.get_broker(...)``;
* presents only ``generation_descriptor()`` and ``query_many(literals)``,
  which is what ``semantic_snapshot_for_model_row()`` consumes;
* performs every semantic read as one bounded operation (acquire or reuse,
  lease, validate, interpret, release, clear references) and retains no
  lease, view, provider or result object afterwards;
* establishes authority health from successful canonical admission plus
  validation of the requested view (reviewer decision R3). No whole-Master
  count thresholds are used;
* offers an expected-generation freshness check for later wiring.

Any failure in that chain raises ``CpmAuthorityUnavailable`` (or its
subclass ``CpmGenerationMismatch``). A failure never becomes MasterUnknown,
absence or Review input.

Not used, directly or indirectly: G18AN's development sidecar discovery,
its TXT provider, its ``get_semantic_provider()`` singleton, or any
fallback. Nothing here is wired into a runnable CPM yet (that is Step 2b).
