"""Canonical installed-package bootstrap -- Package-Boundary Correction
(2026-09-21), Section 8.

Purpose: let SFM MAINMENU-level entry code locate (a) the SFM game
installation root and (b) the canonical installed shared-authority
publication directory, WITHOUT depending on:

  - `__file__` on the top-level MAINMENU entry script (established fact:
    "`__file__` is not assumed to exist in MAINMENU execution" --
    `docs/qualification/CPM_ASTRA_AUTHORITY_CONSUMER_DOSSIER.md` Section
    "Runtime environment assumptions"; confirmed independently for the
    real frozen production Normalizer, which never references
    `__file__` or `sys.executable` at all -- it derives paths from the
    loaded `ifm.dll`'s own path instead, a heavier native-module
    dependency this bootstrap module deliberately avoids needing);
  - the current working directory (not a reliable identity in the SFM
    host process -- "Working directory may be the SFM `game` directory
    and is not used as semantic identity", same dossier section);
  - any repository-relative or qualification-candidate-relative path.

Root derivation mechanism: `os.path.dirname(sys.executable)` --
confirmed against the REAL embedded Python 2.7.5 interpreter
(`docs/qualification/SFM_MASTER_SIDECAR_GATE1_H1_PY27_RUNTIME_AUDIT.md`:
`sys.executable == 'E:\\SteamLibrary\\...\\SourceFilmmaker\\game\\sfm.exe'`)
-- i.e. `sys.executable`'s own directory IS the SFM `game` root directly,
available immediately at Python startup, before any native module
(`ifm.dll`) needs to be loaded. This is a DIFFERENT, simpler mechanism
than `resolver.py`'s ifm.dll-based Master-path derivation (which exists
for a different purpose: corroborating the ACTIVE, LOADED ifm.dll
against a resolved Master path) -- this module never touches or assumes
ifm.dll at all.

This module does NOT itself install/copy the package anywhere, and does
NOT itself compile or publish a Master. It only locates: given the game
root, where does the canonical installed publication live, and does
`sys.modules` already show a canonical, non-duplicate copy of this
package loaded. Actual publication into that location is `tools/
sfm_master_sidecar/publisher.py`'s job (Blocker B); actual ownership/
readiness state is `runtime.py`'s job (already built, Astra F6) -- this
module is the missing link between "no `__file__`/CWD available yet"
and "the rest of the already-qualified ownership machinery."
